	"description": "Balanced map for competitive endeavour on Land, Sea, and Sky if you capture one of the towers. Some towers are on islands on the sea, while one is on the mainland but you'll have to go through narrow valleys to get to it. This map is all about choices, main fighting area is central and is a key position, but don't neglect the conquest of the rest of the map as there is a lot of villages to capture.",
